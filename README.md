# üèóÔ∏è Safe Riding Virtual Reality
An virtual reality project to simulate a realistic experience of riding in Singapore built with A-Frame. 
The application ‚ÄúSafe Riding Trainer‚Äù, serves as a Virtual Reality (VR) simulator that provides users with an immersive experience as a cyclist or Personal Mobility Device (PMD) user. The simulator hopes to promote safe riding in Singapore through a series of tutorials and games that takes place on the roads of Singapore. This includes teaching users the fundamental cycling rules along with safe riding etiquettes. The game will also test the user‚Äôs awareness to obstructions and ability to foresee an accident. The application is meant for anyone to try including non-cyclists. This is to allow the public in general to empathize with the cyclists on the road. The application will be limited to a single player game. This document will consist of the design specification for the application.
